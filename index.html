            <p id="first"> I'm from Queens, NY. I attended The City College of New York (CCNY) for two years, then transferred to Queens College. I recently graduated from Queens College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I am currently looking for any opportunity to gain experience in the tech industry. </p><br>

            <div id="animation2"></div>
            <br>
            <p id="second"> I moved to New York City from Portland, OR to attend Baruch College in 2016 as a Deanâ€™s Scholar. I am currently a senior majoring in Finance and minoring in Mathematics with a Spring 2021 expected graduation. From a young age, I have always been meticulous, and when I found my love for finance my life began to fall into place. I have utilized my analytical and communication skills in courses like econometrics, investment analysis, and corporate finance by leading study sessions and projects among peers. </p><br>

            <br>
            <p id="third"> I cracked the code - I finally figured out why I love programming.  I love programming because I love abstractions; I enjoy analyzing code, and most recently, studying number theory.  Who in their right mind would work for free for long hours and over long periods of time just for the shear joy of programming, of creating something cool or useful or badly needed? You don't do this if it's just a job. You do this because you love to program, love the challenge, love the creation, love the difficulty.  I love to program, and if I ever lose that love, I will no longer be a programmer.  That will be a sad day.</p><br>
